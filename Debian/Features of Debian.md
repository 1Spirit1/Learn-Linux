# What is Debian? Its Definition and Advantages

Debian is also one of the oldest Linux distributions in the world of open-source software. This OS also serves as the basis for Ubuntu, today’s most popular desktop version of Linux. In addition to providing an operating system for computer devices, Debian OS also offers thousands of free software in its repository. Currently, the Debian project is managed by the Debian Constitution and the Social Contract which defines the structure and purpose of the operating system.

Until now, Debian continues to be one of the leading Linux OS. The most distinguishing feature of Debian from other Linux distributions is its package management system.  This system gives the admin full control over all packages installed on that system, including the ability to install a single package or update the entire OS.


## Debian OS Functions
Apart from being a computer operating system, Debian also has many other functions, you know Golden friends! Here are some of them:

1. Provides server services such as DNS servers, mail servers, NTP servers, proxy servers, and other network servers.
2. Perform troubleshooting that can detect errors and errors that exist in a hardware, software, or network.
3. Manage network processes on network system settings such as routers, repeaters, and so on.


## Advantages of Debian Operating System

Millions of people use Debian-based versions of Linux, but what about Debian itself? What is the reason you should use the operating system? Well here we will briefly discuss some of the advantages of the Debian OS and the reasons users use the operating system!

### 1. Super stable 
Debian is known as an operating system that has high stability. This means that this OS rarely experiences system errors even when running heavy programs. This OS tends to use older versions of software that are more reliable and stable.  This means you will be using an older device with minimal bugs.

### 2. Durable
Debian OS also does not have a regular update schedule. Generally, the latest version of this OS comes out every two to three years. So you can avoid the risk of damaging your operating system software with bugs and security holes that may come with new versions. With a minimal update schedule like this, you can use the Debian operating system for a longer period of time.

### 3. Compatible for servers
Thanks to its stable software and long update cycles, Debian is one of the best Linux distro choices for your server. The good news is, you don’t need to use a dedicated debian OS version for this. Use the regular version with supported server tools. In addition, the server does not need to be connected to the internet. You can even use this OS to power up a home server available for computers on a dedicated Wi-Fi network.

### 4. Good support
Thanks to the large number of people using Ubuntu, the debian DEB format is a common application in the Linux world. While not all DEB formats that work on Ubuntu work on Debian, it’s possible that you’ll find DEBs for both. Before you even start looking for third-party software, Debian has some of the largest software repositories you’ll find.

### 5. Open-source
This operating system is also open-source which means users can use and modify this OS freely and for free. This also means that users can modify this operating system depending on your wishes and network needs.

### 6. No need a strong internet connection
Generally, Linux makes software that is free and accessible. However most distros require access to a solid internet connection. Debian provides DVD versions that include a lot of software that you can download from the repositories anytime and from anywhere.
