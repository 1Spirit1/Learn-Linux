# Themes for Debian and Other Linux Distributions

**_Brief: Let’s have a look at some beautiful GNOME themes that you can use not only in Debian but other Linux distributions that use GNOME._**

You probably already know most of the popular options out there. Here, I have tried to keep things fresh along with a few mention to the popular (old) options.


## 1. Orchis GTK Theme

Orchis GTK theme is a stunning theme pack that gives your desktop a clean, unique, and a modern look.

It is one of the first themes to add GNOME 40 support as well. If you are using Firefox as your browser, it even has a theme for it. And, yes, it also mentions the link to the wallpaper (appreciate that!) in Pling’s store page if you want it to look just like the screenshot above.

## 2. WhiteSur

This theme is tailored for users who want a macOS-like user experience on Linux. Of course, this is not apples-to-apples kind of similarity, but it is quite impressive.

You also get a cursor theme, icon theme, Firefox theme, and dash-to-dock theme if you want to make it look as good as it looks in the screenshot.

## 3. Ultimate Dark

If you want all things dark but a variety of black shades in a theme, this could look good for your desktop.

This should be easy on your eyes while also offering a good dark mode experience. You also get a flat and gradient version in the theme pack to choose when setting up.

## 4. Prof-Gnome-Theme

You will find several interesting dark themes out there. However, for some reason, if you do not prefer the pitch-dark shade in most of the dark mode themes, this theme can be a good pick.

It might look a bit dated, but it helps distinguish different elements of the user interface clearly. And, it is also pleasing to the eyes with a dark-grey shade. I’d say it also gives a classic macOS-touch, if that is a good thing for you.

## 5. Paper

Paper has been around for some time now. I remember using it for the first back in 2014. I would say, at this point, Paper is more known for its icon pack than for its GTK theme, but that doesn’t mean that the theme isn’t a wonderful option in and of its self. Even though I adored the Paper icons from the beginning, I can’t say that I was a huge fan of the Paper theme when I first tried it out.

I felt like the bright colors and fun approach to a theme made for an “immature” experience. Now, years later, Paper has grown on me, to say the least, and the light-hearted approach that the theme takes is one I greatly appreciate.

## 6. Flat Remix

If you haven’t noticed by this point, I am a sucker for someone who pays attention to the details in the close, minimize, maximize buttons. The color theme that Flat Remix uses is one I have not seen anywhere else, with a red, blue, and orange color way. Add that on top of a theme that looks almost like a mix between Arc and Adapta, and you have Flat Remix.

I am personally a fan of the dark option, but the light alternative is very nice as well. So if you like subtle transparencies, a cohesive dark theme, and a touch of color here and there, Flat Remix is for you.


## 7. Material Black Frost

If you’re a fan of material design – this comes close to what you would want to have on your Linux distro.

Unfortunately, you do not get color options here but the default color is pretty decent and pleasant to look at.

## 8. Cloudy

A simple and basic theme that should look good on any Linux distro. This might appear to resemble the look of a modern XFCE desktop-like Zorin Lite but closer.

You will find a variety of color shades available to download. Try it and see what works for you.
