Blackarch now contains over 1800 tools for i686 and x86_64 and over 1000 tools for armv6h and armv7h. This is quite impressive considering that a few years ago when the project was begun, there were about 600 tools available for users. The tools are organized in over 40 different groups. Examples of these groups are –​blackarch-anti-forensic – Packages that are used for countering forensic activities, including encryption, steganography, and anything that modifies files/file attributes.

blackarch-automation --> Packages that are used for tool or workflow automation. 

Blackarch-decompiler -->  Packages that attempt to reverse a compiled program into the source code.

Blackarch-defensive --> Packages that are used to protect a user from malware and attacks from other users.

Blackarch-dos --> Packages that use DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.

Blackarch-mobile --> Packages that manipulate mobile platforms.

Blackarch-networking --> Package that involves IP networking.
