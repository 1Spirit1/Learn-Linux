## Fedora Workstation
 Fedora Workstation is a reliable, user-friendly, and powerful operating system for your laptop or desktop computer. It supports a wide range of developers, from hobbyists and students to professionals in corporate environments. 
 
 ## Fedora 37
- Fedora 37 is the latest version (currently in BETA) of Fedora Workstation. It ships with Gnome 43 which includes a new device security panel in Settings, providing the user with information about the security of hardware and firmware on the system. Building on the previous release, more core GNOME apps have been ported to the latest version of the GTK toolkit, providing improved performance and a modern look. 
- In order to keep up with advances in cryptography, this release introduces a TEST-FEDORA39 policy that previews changes planned for Fedora Linux 39. The new policy includes a move away from SHA-1 signatures.
- The Raspberry Pi 4 is now officially supported in Fedora Linux, including accelerated graphics. In other ARM news, Fedora Linux 37 Beta drops support for the ARMv7 architecture (also known as arm32 or armhfp).
- Thereâ€™s the usual update of programming languages and libraries: Python 3.11, Perl 5.36, Golang 1.19, and more!
