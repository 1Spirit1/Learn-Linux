LibreOffice is a **free and open source** office suite which is the default office suite for most popular linux distros.

It is a project of The Document Foundation (TDF).
The LibreOffice suite consists of programs for word processing, creating and editing spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams, and drawings, working with 
databases, and composing mathematical formulae. It is available in 115 languages.

LibreOffice is available for various computing platforms, including Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Chromebook. It is also available as an
online office suite called LibreOffice Online.
