Kubuntu comes Ubuntu with KDE and the Plasma desktop, bringing you a full set of applications including productivity, 
office, email, graphics, photography, and music applications ready to use at startup with extensive additional software 
installed from not one, but two desktop package managers.

Built using the Qt toolkit, Kubuntu is fast, slick and beautiful. Kubuntu is mobile-ready, enabling easy integration between 
your PC desktop and phone or tablet with KDE Connect.

**2. Lubuntu** <br/>

Lubuntu is designed to be a simple, easy to use system that is light, fast and modern. Lubuntu provides the LXQt desktop environment 
which is focused on Qt technologies. Lubuntu comes with the essential applications and services needed to browse the Internet, chat, 
play and be productive.

Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system with a configurable desktop environment. It is ideal for those who want the most out 
of their computers and prefer a traditional desktop metaphor. With modest hardware requirements it is suitable for modern workstations, 
single board computers and older hardware alike. Ubuntu MATE makes modern computers fast and old computers usable.

Ubuntu Budgie is a proud official Ubuntu flavour. We combine the simplicity and elegance of the Budgie desktop environment with the power 
and familiarity of an Ubuntu based operative system.

The result is a modern and fast desktop distribution with great defaults, yet fully customizable.

**5. Ubuntu Kylin** <br/>
