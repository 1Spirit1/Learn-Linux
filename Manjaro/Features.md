# Manjaro and its Features

- Manjaro is a user-friendly Linux distribution based on the independently developed Arch operating system. 
- Within the Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an exceptionally fast, powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the very latest cutting edge - and bleeding edge - software. 
- However, Arch is also aimed at more experienced or technically-minded users. 
- As such, it is generally considered to be beyond the reach of those who lack the technical expertise (or persistence) required to use it.
